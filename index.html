    <h1><b>Drugless Driving - Impaired Driving Prevention</b></h1>
      <p> Drugless Driving is a universal interface focused on preventing impaired driving by inhibiting the operation of a vehicle while intoxicated. <br> Drugless Driving conducts a breath test compatible with multiple drug detection devices to measure the level of impairment in an individual, <br> along with facial recognition to prevent cheating. We have a vision where impaired drivers will never be behind the wheel.</p>

    <div class="w3-col l3 m6 w3-light-grey w3-container w3-padding-16">
      <h3>Universality</h3>
      <p>Drugless Driving acts as a platform which can connect to a multitude of drug detection devices for various substances dependant on the specific customer. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-col l3 m6 w3-grey w3-container w3-padding-16">
      <h3>Prevention</h3>
      <p> Drugless Driving focuses on prevention of vehicle access before impaired drivers get on the road, and use occasional checks to ensure that they stay sober.  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-col l3 m6 w3-dark-grey w3-container w3-padding-16">
      <h3>Precise</h3>
      <p>Drugless Driving uses face recognition technology to confirm that the person who passes the verification is the one at the wheel of the vehicle. Cheating will not be a concern for the system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-col l3 m6 w3-black w3-container w3-padding-16">
      <h3>Seamless</h3>
      <p> The druglesss driving procedure is quick and intiuitive, with all the components integrated seamlessly into the body of the vehicle making the checks a marginal delay.</p>

      <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
      <p class="ex1" align=LEFT> Drug-related driving incidents has doubled in Canada in 2017 compared to in 2009. After Canada legalized cannabis, the National Cannabis Survey reported, <q> About one in seven (14%) cannabis users with a driver's licence reported driving within two hours of using.</q>. Drugs impair judgement, coordination, and reaction times. On average, 4 Canadians are killed daily due to impaired driving. In 2014, 299 road deaths were caused by drunk drivers, 618 deaths were caused by drugged drivers, and 356 deaths were caused by drivers impaired by both. Furthermore, cannabis accounted for half of the drug-related deaths. Impaired driving affects not only drivers but also passengers, bystanders, and family members. <q> One in three Canadians report that they have ridden in a vehicle operated by an impaired driver.</q> </p>

	  <h3>The History of Impaired Driving</h3>
	  <p class="ex1" align=LEFT>The problem of impaired driving in Canada was deemed a criminal offence in 1921 and nationally recognized as a criminal act in 1925 . Despite the laws, more than 70,000 DUI incidents were still being reported in 2015, almost a century later. </p>

		<p class="ex1" align=LEFT>The breath alcohol ignition interlock device, BAIID, was invented in 1969 that prevents alcohol-impaired driving. In 2000, Ontario amended its laws to form the ignition interlock program which requires a convicted person of an impaired driving offence to install a BAIID into their car. Companies like Alcolock and Sober Steering are in the market solving the problem of alcohol impaired driving via such ignition interlock devices. These companies directly connect an alcohol-detection device with a locking mechanism into the vehicle to prevent it from starting if the driver tests positively over the defined limit. </p>

		<p class="ex1" align=LEFT>Driving under the influence had been heavily focused on alcohol because it was the only legal intoxicating substance. The recent legality changes increase the sense of urgency for adequate vehicle-drug testing. Drug-related fatalities occur twice as often as alcohol-related ones, of which 50% involve marijuana. While this problem affects the masses, previous convicted drivers, public bus drivers, and truck drivers, often engulfed in the high stress drug subculture, pose a higher risk of driving under the influence and harming a greater amount of people, the solution should be targeted towards them first. </p>

		<p class="ex1" align=LEFT>The number of people that see the use of cannabis as impacting their lives has increased due to the media attention brought on by its legalization. The popular public opinion is that local law enforcement are ill-prepared for the changes . 
		</p>

		<h3>Failure Analysis</h3>
	    <p class="ex1" align=LEFT> The currently practiced countermeasures by authorities against impaired driving are a series of roadside tests, which may be in the form of a standardized field sobriety test, or providing a breath or saliva sample to screening equipment. Roadside testing fails to solve the impaired driving because it is a reactive measure to catch impaired drivers already behind the wheel rather than a proactive, preventative measure that prevents the act of driving under the influence. </p>

		<p class="ex1" align=LEFT> The Ontario Ignition Interlock program attempts to reduce the number of repeat offences since 16% of DUI accusations are directed at previously-accused individuals. But despite the introduction of the program adding the extra condition of alcohol-sobriety to operating a vehicle, it has not solved the issue of driving while intoxicated. The program targets previously convicted individuals; the program is again a reactive solution to the first DUI offence. It does however prevent the would-be following incidents (the proactive portion of the solution). </p>

		<p class="ex1" align=LEFT> Other reasons why it does not solve the problem are that the installed devices are alcohol-specific, which is insufficient for the newly-legalized cannabis and all other prescription drugs; or that the program is not mandatory. If you should choose not to install the device in your car, the alternative is an honour-based system where you do not drive until the condition is removed from your licence .</p> 

		<p class="ex1" align=LEFT> Alcohol breathalyzers are not standard in all vehicles because people do not like the idea of being controlled and regulated. Furthermore, the seamlessness of their integration and ease of use are low while the time required to conduct a test is high. This would be a nuisance to someone trying to start the car once a day, forget multiple times a day. Lastly, from a pure quantitative point of view, the number of deaths due to intoxicated driving do not justify the increased cost of installation coming straight out of taxpayer money. </p>

		<p class="ex1" align=LEFT> Drug detection integration needs to be as seamless as the fingerprint scanner, virtual assistants, or face ID on your phone, where a user may suspect that his information may be recorded and used for unapproved purposes, but the ease of use provided triumphs his concerns. </p>

From a software architecture point of view, Abhishank has extensive formal experience with transactional database development (Aeroplan Reward Miles), focusing on securely optimizing the reading and writing of data. The concepts of data abstraction, encapsulation, and retrieval directly carry over to this project where large amounts of data needs to be quickly retrieved at once (comparison of face done to millions of other users) and one subset of code cannot access and corrupt the other (facial recrognition starts manipulating GPS coordinates). </p>
